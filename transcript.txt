challenges here overcoming this project are first of all the stock market nowadays the rapid moments are due to the news the sentiment and technical indicators so complexity of interpreting these multiple influencing factors is very hard and the human analysis is very slow and error-prone and traders and investors also struggle to make timely and accurate decisions so this project we are using to automate automates analysis to deliver the fast and more reliable insights so what are now we are doing in this project it will autonomously collect the news and financial data from multiple sources and we also have a sentiment analysis which will give scores based on the each and every news and says how the prediction will go and you also have some technical analysis which will identify their trends and signals we it will give investment strategies like whether to buy or hold or sell the particular share and also it has the project the it will run a simulation and outcome give outcome has the projected potential returns and risks so coming to the architecture what are you using the front-end the architectures uses react and the back-end we are using the fast API for the communication with the front-end the agents and then we are coming to the agents so the agents now we are using our news agent it will collect the news and market agent which will analyze the stock market data from financial analysis sentiment agent which gives the sentiment based on the collected news and insights strategy agent it will strategize a particular plan depending on all these news and inform other informations based on the these datas it will give a strategy and simulation also happens simultaneously which will show what will be the outcome based on the decisions you will take so and that yeah these are the five agents you use six agents you are using so now what are the key features in the back-end first ones you are using fast API which is empowering core service like an analyze and integration Yahoo finance which is a real-time use API which will give many in real-time data and we are also using sentiment analysis for hugging face more transformers like a Finbert etc model which has very high accuracy and we also use detecting the keyword based so whether the detection fails also it will give a particular standard output and you also having multiple technical indicators now coming to front-end yeah these are the things which will have in the front-end it will have interactive charts stock charts it will have a driven investment profiles it will have a analysis of each and everything and the news articles will be also labeled so coming to a demo so this is the flow chart on how the work happens not boring you guys yeah so this is how the analysis looks like if I get Tesla and 30-day investment it will give the sentiment the confidence and the project gain for each and every day so these are the whole strengths challenges and future decisions we are taking now coming to the project so this is the stock market analyzer project now I'm giving a particular stock I'm giving Google and a new for 30 days and my investment down to $1,000 by $10,000 based on these data now you can see in the back end will start to work yeah just fetching the information for Google and detecting news etc and at last successfully you the end product so it's getting some output yeah there's the summarizer it shows like Google analysis with my 0.34 so based on these the current market sentiment and technical indicators so recommendation it's telling to sell with 5% portfolio allocation for optimal risk adjustment so these are the recommendations it will give how much confidence with the plan and the investment strategy it will give a risk assessment and how much extra strategy etc so yeah this is the stock price though this is you can look like green so it's increasing but still the overall is based on all these sentiment and etc etc features figure doesn't what will be the loss or gain so this is the simulation and yeah it shows 15 positive news and 5 neutral news out of a given strategy the investment strategy is sell yeah as I informed the combined score sentiment score the technical score based on these so it shows recommended investment is $0 because you don't need to recommend anything and the risk level is very moderate also yeah the risk level is nothing but the opportunities we can give us positive news sentiment also entry strategy it's saying not to enter so if it is different it will give a different like enter and what are the target price we have to have so it's tilts now to wait for better signals and our new portion it also the exit strategy so yeah it was a give exit trouble you stop loss $100 you have to exit so what are the occupations and how much portfolio we also have a technical analysis which says whether it does yeah as you can see it's a short term also bearish and long term it's bearish it means it's decreasing so based on these it will show what are the at last we also have the news the news analysis shows what are the news it is neutral there is positive so based on these news only this articles only the final output is given so yeah this is the complete project on stock market analysis
